    <h1>
        IMPACT OF JAPA SYNDROME ON NIGERIA 
    </h1>

    <h2>
        What is Japa?
    </h2>

    <p>Japa has been a trend coined from the yoruba language which means "To run away". 
        This trend has lead to lot of skilled workers, professionals, especially, medical practitioners, bankers, techies, academias among others are leaving Nigeria for greener pasture abroad.
        This has also lead to brain drain across every sector in the country </p>


    <h2>
        Why most people Japa
    </h2>

    <p>Recent studies have shown that a key driver of the exodus of Nigerians to Europe and America is the need to escape the harsh economic condition in the country. These conditions include worsening security situation, rising unemployment, high cost of living, and bad governance and leadership, amongst others
        Many who are today caught up in the 'Japa' syndrome say they have lost hope in Nigeria and believe the country practically has no promises for them. While many have chosen the education and employment route to 'Japa', others chose more extremely dangerous expeditions, either crossing the deserts of northern Africa or attempting perilous trips through the Mediterranean Sea. The belief, therefore, is that immigrating to other parts of the world would afford them better education, better career opportunities, better-paying jobs, and of course, a safer and more secure future for their children. These benefits, they believe are quite elusive in Nigeria at the moment.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Disadvantages of Japa.
    </h2>

    <p>There's no doubt that the current 'Japa' trend is leaving a huge skill gap in most organizations. Great talents have continued to emigrate from the country as companies are losing a lot of their best hands who take with them years of training and skills to foreign countries. This leaves a gap in many organisations which subsequently has to be filled by newer talents that may not necessarily be as experienced as those who have left these organisations. In other words, organisations have to repeatedly invest in the retraining of staff.</p>
    
    <p>Emigration has stunted the growth of some key industries in Nigeria. Imagine a health sector where the best doctors have emigrated, a tech sector where the best techies are expressing their talents in Europe and America, and an academic system where the best academics have taken their knowledge abroad. Imagine this scenario for every other sector of the economy.</p>

    <h2>
        Merit of Japa to Nigeria Economy.
    </h2>

    <p>We cannot underestimate the positive side of the 'Japa' syndrome which is in diaspora remittance inflow. Between January and June of 2022, Nigerians received $10.11 as diaspora remittances, according to Nairametrics. 
         Nigeria's diaspora remittance in a way gives the CBN the firepower to meet the pent-up demand for foreign exchange and defend the Naira against volatility. Remittances from the diaspora play an important role in the lives of recipients and are one of the most important sources of external flows of capital and forex for developing countries.</p>

    <h3>
        Personal Opinion
    </h3>

    <p>Personally, I beleive its better for a Nigerian planning to Japa to have the required skills that is highly needed and in high demand
        in order to be able to cope and survive in any country they are emigrating to. Europe and America are also in recession and most of their big company are laying off workers(high;yskilled citizens)
        There are lot of challenges abroad also, They have access to  AI, Programming ETC since they were toddler where as, Nigerians are just moving to the direction now, All thnaks to Covid-19 pandemic.

        I BELIEVE FOR A PERSON TO JAPA YOU MUST HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO JAPA
